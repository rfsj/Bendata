### ðŸ“ŠNewcomb-Benford's Law

Due to the exponential growth of data, there was a need for changes in the methods of verifying its authenticity with emphasis on trust relationships in data that are mostly found in open data. The main criteria about propounding the creation of this new tool was consolidated with the appropriation of a digit distribution technique, mainly used in the area of accounting fraud detection, based on the probabilities of numbers occurrence starting with smaller digits being higher than the probabilities of numbers starting with higher digits, a phenomenon named by Newcomb (1881) and Benford (1938), from the Newcomb-Benford Law, initiating  a change on new models of accounting relationships. The accomplishment of this work comes from the need to estimate possible divergences in expenses assigned to each parliamentarian through a quota destined to defray typical costs to the exercise of its mandate, found in the open data portal of the Chamber of Federal Deputies, where it was expected to verify whether or not the bases matched the Newcomb-Benford Law. From the analysis of the data set made available by the Chamber of Deputies, it was concluded that not all data were in compliance with the Newcomb-Benford Law, according to the statistical analysis of the Mean Absolute Deviation.The Calculate function found in the file calculateBenford.py(Codedrome, 2019).
